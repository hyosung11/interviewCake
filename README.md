## Big O Notation
1. how quickly runtime grows
2. relative to the input
3. as the input get arbitrarily large

Drop the constants
Drop the less significant terms
Worst case

Space complexity

Balance runtime, space, implementation time, maintainability, and readability.

## Data Structures
reading from sequential memory addresses is faster than jumping around

### Arrays
Arrays have fast lookups (O(1) time), but each item in the array needs to be the same size, and you need a big block of uninterrupted free memory to store the array.
